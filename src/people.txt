How absurd! For a mere mortal to slay me!?
Ahahah, this mere mortal is apparently a hero!
A Hero?? Nooooo! Such power!
Alright, now I'm off to get your treasure!

Hello there, villager.

Hm? Ah now that i see it, you're not one of us.
Yes, I just arrived.
I'd like to ask something from you. This is related to our villagers looking unfriendly to newcomers like you.
Oh, a quest? What might it be?
Please, you must clear the Cave to the north of this place. There are lots of monster there.
Hm, that sounds not too hard. Okay.
.
Have you cleared the Cave yet?

Have you cleared the Cave yet?
I can't even enter it.
Ah, looks like the Wizard's barrier still active. Sorry about that.
Barrier?
Yes, just ask him to set it off for a bit so you can enter.

Go ask the Wizard, will you?

Hm- what? Oh sorry, i was lost in thought.
null
.
And this and then .. Oh sorry, didn't see you there.
Hey, can you turn the barrier off for a bit?
What?! Are you crazy?
Is that a problem?
Well, the Cave is pretty much harmless, but it will attract wolves from the Eastern Forest!
So if I kill some of the wolves you can turn the barrier off?
You can try though- Be careful! There are at least 3 wolves there!
No problem.
.
I can't believe you really killed those beast.
Well, it's not as easy as i thought.
There, I put off the barrier. Good luck!

Good luck!
